## Synopsis

This is the 3 o'Clock music jukebox, a real time web app that provides user creation, login, video search(utube), video playback(utube), voting system, tops for songs and players. This is a creative effort to encourage people to use modern tools and concepts.

It's mobile ready, the UI is kept as clean as possible, making it easy to use, 2mins explanation is all it takes to add-vote songs.

## The Motive

Provide a voting system for the Hangar community to listen their music. Their music culture is capture in a more democratic way, the passion for creating new things, increasing the social interaction within the teams. This can be at social events, Fridays at 3 o'Clock, technical exchange events, any where.

It needs more feedback to grow and generate more users. The queue creation process is not as simple as "vote" and "play", it needs variaty, it needs to encourage rookie players, hold the "vote" hunters. This creates all kind of rules in the code.

So once we got some of these rules we came up with the simple, add-vote-play app we have now, and we're working on the new rules for a more engaging experience.
